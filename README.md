#### After 45 Years, A Refugee Community in the Bronx is Moving On

======

###### 1975 was a watershed year in Southeast Asia. It marked the Fall of Saigon, as well as the beginning of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Refugees from both countries made homes across the US, primarily on the West coast. In New York, a group of Cambodians, Laotians and South Vietnamese were moved into Kingsbridge Heights, in the Bronx. But 45 years later, that once tight-knit community is dissolving.

###### This is a story that looks at the history of a unique New York neighborhood, at how they coped in the Bronx as they dealt with the trauma of transatlantic transplant, and what factors are squeezing them out.

======

## Data: American Community Survey from 2000 to 2018.

###### The data analysis on this is pretty light. Change over time is a decrease. But supplementary to that is the fact that while the Viet population, for example, has gone down across New York, other Asian diasporas in the city have grown. The data shows that too.
